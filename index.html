            <h2>Beloved Memo,</h2>
            <p class="letter">On this day, the anniversary of you winning THE race to come into this world,<br>
                Here I am trying to take on this impossible task of capturing your essence in prose. <br>
                You silly crackhead protein addicted idiot, are to all appearances,
                <br> a paradox wrapped beautifully in silk and sunlight.
                You saunter through the world cloaked in grace, with the smirk and the 
                aura of someone has seen and been through too much, yet still chooses laughter.<br>
                There is an alluring gleam in your eyes that says YOU have survived the toughest of storms<br>
                 and 
                stitched yourself back together using a thread only you could see.<Br>
                You jest, you banter, playing at vanity like it is your own private joke.<br>
                 But I see youâ€”oh, how clearly I see you.
                Beneath all the tough exterior, <br>
                there is a sweet woman who's gentle and caring of others.
                I can tell you feel deeply about those you care about. Perhaps even more than you let on
                â€”and your tears, though hidden, are sacred. <br>
                You give of yourself so often, so quietly, that most do not even realize the weight 
                you carry while they rest in the warmth of your light.
                
                And oh, what a light you are Memo. <br>
                Unreplicable, irreplaceble, you shine in ways that cannot be taught or mimicked. <br>
                Your beautyâ€”unquestionable, unequivocal, impossible to ignoreâ€”is only matched by the originality of your style,
                which bends no knee to convention.
                it is an honor to have found someone like you, an honor that we are like in all the ways that matter,
                and unlike in all the ways that make YOU remarkable.
                You are your own tempest storm, your own sunshine, your own melodyâ€”and I remain ever so enchanted.
                <br>
                May this be the year you laugh louder, cry softer, and see yourself the way we all doâ€”truly.
                <br>
                Yours truly,<br>
                R.J
